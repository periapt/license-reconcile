1) reconcile bwctl and mysql
2.) Need to treat UNKNOWN license differently. We have no license to check
and must not generate an error for a license mismatch. But the copyright is
still checkable.
3.) debian packaging
4.) licensecheck has '/' as a line separator
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*.) proposal to eliminate dependency on System::Command in 'io' branch
4.) test coverage
*) config should be below debian/source actually and we should be cleverer about
the name.
*.) Max relative width should be configurable
4.) Need a Dh_Sequence as well.
11.) exclude files from mapping configurably
6.) Could do with a man page for the config file format.
13.) floundered on bwctl format spec - double space after the colon.
*) expose --check and --exclude licensecheck options
*) file permissions rule clause
*) allow rules to read only the first N bytes - but benchmark
*) Look at alternatives to Text::LevenshteinXS and Set::IntSpan such as
Set::IntSpan::Fast::XS and benchmark.
Use Class::Load::load_first_existing_class and thank mst. or Class::Load::XS
9.) allow the filter sequence to be explicitly set in the config file.
*) Should also allow these classes to be configured. This would require
a Debian::LicenseReconcile::CopyrightDatum::Config (to be loaded first)
and Debian::LicenseReconcile::CopyrightDatum only to be loaded when needed
(which is good anyway).
