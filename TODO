1.) expose --check and --exclude licensecheck options
2.) file permissions rule clause
3.) allow rules to read only the first N bytes - but benchmark
4.) copyright checking
5.) Need to treat UNKOWN license differently. We have no license to check
and must not generate an error for a license mismatch. But the copyright is
still checkable.
6.) app module
7.) exit status would be safer just 0 or 1
8.) test coverage
9.) debian packaging
10.) Docs: how to use, config
11.) exclude files from mapping configurably
12.) Documentation should talk about Justififcation field rather than Comment
13.) Document filter aliases
14.) There is a bug in the licensecheck handling
licensecheck gets the results for cmd-line-utils/libedit/tty.c
but the wrapper does not return it
