1.) Debian::LicenseReconcile must cache the copyright and license objects
keyed by pattern. It should do this at startup which will require a slight
change of interface.
2.) Need to treat UNKNOWN license differently. We have no license to check
and must not generate an error for a license mismatch. But the copyright is
still checkable.
3.) There is a bug in the licensecheck handling
licensecheck gets the results for cmd-line-utils/libedit/tty.c
but the wrapper does not return it
4.) Need a Dh_Sequence as well.
5.) Should be able to turn off copyright checking as it will be very slow.
6.) Could do with a man page for the config file format.
7.) app module
8.) test coverage
9.) allow the filter sequence to be explicitly set in the config file.
10.) debian packaging
11.) exclude files from mapping configurably
12.) expose --check and --exclude licensecheck options
13.) file permissions rule clause
14.) allow rules to read only the first N bytes - but benchmark
15.) floundered on bwctl format spec - why
